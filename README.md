Book typer is something I created for myself to try to convince myself to read, and ended up just coding instead. It loads any txt file and displays it. You type each character and your cursor will move through, marking everything that has already been typed through. You can also change the color schemes


Coded purely in python utilizing the standard tkinter toolkit.

### Functionality
- Type through and book in txt format
- Save position in book.
- Change themes on the fly
- Scroll though with `up` and `down`
- Scroll through pages with `left` and `right`
- Skip to the end with `shift-right` and back to the top with `shift-left`

### Usage

`python3 book_typer.py`
